See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/ for a very readable intro to fonts generally.

Per http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-style-matching

    The procedure for choosing a font for a given character in a run of text consists of 
    iterating over the font families named by the ‘font-family’ property, selecting a 
    font face with the appropriate style based on other font properties and then determining 
    whether a glyph exists for the given character. This is done using the character map 
    of the font, data which maps characters to the default glyph for that character. A 
    font is considered to support a given character if (1) the character is contained in
    the font's character map and (2) if required by the containing script, shaping 
    information is available for that character.

https://github.com/plutext/flyingsaucer/blob/master/demos/samples/src/VerifyGlyphExists.java
uses java.awt.Font.canDisplay(char c)

FOP also has some way of doing this:- http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/trunk/fonts.html

But our implementation currently assumes the first font family for which we have a mapping
will contain a glyph.

TODO: test whether FS supports shorthand font property http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-prop

Examples:

p { font: 12pt/14pt sans-serif }
p { font: 80% sans-serif }
p { font: x-large/110% "new century schoolbook", serif }
p { font: bold italic large Palatino, serif }
p { font: normal small-caps 120%/120% fantasy }
p { font: condensed oblique 12pt "Helvetica Neue", serif; }

-----------

Flying-saucer gives us something like:

font-style: normal; 
font-variant: normal; 
font-weight: normal; 
font-size: 8pt; 
font-family: Century Gothic,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;

----------

flying-saucer can embed custom fonts via CSS, using @font-face. [Note that 

In principle, docx4j could automatically embed this font in the docx. But we don't try to do this
 in the current implementation.
 
See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#src-desc for some known font formats.

TEST whether FS supports this?

Per https://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/wiki/FAQPDF

Embedding fonts using CSS @font-face
flying-saucer can embed custom fonts via CSS. Make sure the path to the font file is relative to the path of the CSS file.

@font-face {
        font-family: "UbuntuMono";
        src: url("UbuntuMono-R.ttf");
        -fs-pdf-font-embed: embed;
        -fs-pdf-font-encoding: Identity-H; 
}

* {
        font-family: "UbuntuMono";
}
